**Problem statement**
This project evaluates the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns by analyzing ROI, conversion rates, and channel efficiency to support data-driven budget allocation and campaign optimization.


**Tools Used**
PowerBi Desktop
DAX (CTR, Conversion Rate, ROI calculations)


**Dataset Overview**
Number of Records: 1,000 rows
Number of Fields: 11 columns
Metrics analyzed: Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, Spend, Revenue, CTR, ROI
Date Range Covered: November 2024 – February 2025
Initial Data Quality Issues Identified: None


**Data transformation**
- Data types were standardized, and calculated measures(CTR, Conversion Rate, and ROI) were created to evaluate campaign efficiency and profitability.  


**Key Insights**
- Cold Drink generated the highest revenue (₹19.1M) despite moderate ad spend, indicating strong product-market fit.
- Cooking Oil received the highest ad allocation but ranked lower in revenue contribution, suggesting inefficient spend. 
- Google Ads accounted for the largest share of total spend (₹530K), requiring efficiency review.
- Referral has the highest engagement(5.34%) and strongest conversions(250K+) indicating high-intent traffic. 
- Peak campaign performance occurred in December 2024 and January 2025, confirming seasonal demand impact(holidays, New Year).
- January records the highest conversions (460k+) with only a small increase in spend. 
- February showed a decline in revenue and conversions, likely due to post-season budget reduction or campaigns not optimized for off-season demand.


**Recommendations**
- Increase visibility/or run promotions for top revenue generating products. Keep some ad budget for brand awareness & seasonal promotions. 
- Optimize or reduce spend on underperforming campaigns.
- Reassess spend allocation, consider refining targeting/keywords or landing page experience to improve efficiency for Google Ads. 
- Expand referral incentives (loyalty rewards, discounts for referring friends/family, influencer partnerships). 
- Investigate the causes of the loss campaigns (31) and decide whether to optimize, retarget, or permanently cut those campaigns.
- Maintain baseline spend during off-season to prevent sharp performance decline.

  
**Outcome**
The project delivered a comprehensive performance evaluation of the company’s digital marketing campaigns, identifying high-ROI categories, underperforming campaigns, seasonal trends, and budget inefficiencies. The analysis provides actionable insights to optimize marketing spend, improve conversion efficiency, and support data-driven strategic decision-making.
