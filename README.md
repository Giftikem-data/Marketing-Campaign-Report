Key Insights
The Electronics category generated the highest total revenue despite not having the highest transaction volume, indicating stronger sales of higher-priced products. A moderate performance difference is observed across the categories.
Sales peaked in December 2022 and December 2023, highlighting clear seasonality in customer purchasing patterns.
Transactions are relatively balanced across genders, with female customers accounting for a slightly higher share (~51%)
The evening period accounts for the largest proportion of orders (~53.2%), establishing it as the primary peak operating window, while afternoon sales record the lowest activity levels.

Recommendations
Prioritize electronics inventory management and explore premium bundling strategies to maximize high-value revenue contribution.
Prepare operational capacity and targeted marketing campaigns ahead of December to leverage seasonal demand.
Maintain inclusive marketing strategies given balanced gender participation while optimizing category-specific campaigns.
Strengthen operational readiness during evening peak hours and implement targeted promotions to improve afternoon sales performance.
